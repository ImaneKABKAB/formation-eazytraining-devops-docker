# ⚠️ Private registry

We build a Docker private registry to store the produced images .

We create 2 containers :

 - Registry backend container where we store images 
 
 - Registry user interface  to facilitate managing the images
 
 To do so we use this docker-compose.yml file https://github.com/ImaneKABKAB/formation-eazytraining-devops-docker/blob/main/private-registry/docker-compose.yml
 
 Here is the result image ![private](https://github.com/ImaneKABKAB/formation-eazytraining-devops-docker/blob/main/images/TP8.png)
