# üßæProject theme

The project aims to :

‚úî Containerize a simple application .

‚úî Automate the deployement infrastructure using Iac approach.

‚úî Push the application image to a Docker private registry.

The application lists the students with their  ages using a webserver (PHP) and an API (Flask).

I list through this repo all the process for accomplishing the project .

# üîßBuild and Test 
At this step , we will build a Docker image for the student_age api and to do so we will write a Dockerfile 

(https://github.com/ImaneKABKAB/formation-eazytraining-devops-docker/blob/main/student-list/simple_api/Dockerfile) where we specify the libraries , dependecies and the source file of the app .

To test it we use the curl command and we should see as an output the students list with ages as in the follow image

# ‚öôÔ∏èInfrastructure automation
At this phsase , we deploy the application using Iac approach by writing a docker-compose.yml file
(https://github.com/ImaneKABKAB/formation-eazytraining-devops-docker/blob/main/student-list/docker-compose.yml).

The application is devided into 2 services :

 - API service : it represents the api 
 
 - Website service : it represents the user interface 
 
 We put the 2 services in the same network of type bridge .
 
 We have as result  a site as the follow image

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Private registry
We build a Docker private registry to store the produced images .

We create 2 containers :

 - Registry backend container where we store images 
 
 - Registry user interface  to facilitate managing the images
 
 To do so we use this docker-compose.yml file https://github.com/ImaneKABKAB/formation-eazytraining-devops-docker/blob/main/private-registry/docker-compose.yml
 
 Here is the result image ![private](https://github.com/ImaneKABKAB/formation-eazytraining-devops-docker/blob/main/images/TP8.png)
