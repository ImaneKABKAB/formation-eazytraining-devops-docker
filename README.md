# 😃Hi this is a simple presentation of my work during my 1st month of Eazy-Training DevOps bootcamp😃

I create this repository to map my progress during the first month of the bootcamp(September 2022 to November 2022). It is a sort of proof of work. 
This repo will contain some Docker labs i did and a Docker mini project which i realised at the end of the first month.


# 👩A quick presentation of me and my cursus👩

I'm an engineering student ,pursuing an engineering degree in Information Technologies and Communication networks ,this is my last year.
This is  a list of some projects i did:

✔️I did an internship with a colleague during which we sat up a personal cloud for storage using ownCloud platform and virtualbox.

✔️I also did an internship with a group of colleagues inside WebHelp call center during which we created a website for managing a game room using the .Net framework, Sql server for backend and vue.js framework for frontend.

✔️I also tried to make a simple website (it's my first one) for renting and selling properties using php , mysql and css .

✔️During a worshop with my classmates , i made a simple website for monitoring and visualizing a refrigerator temperature using Django framework , Sqlite and arduino for the hardware part. you can visit it on [https://ima.pythonanywhere.com/]

😀I'm also interested in DevOps technologies , i started searching and reading about it since my third year of studies trying to understand what is CI/CD pipelines.

  This year i decided to join the Eazy-training DevOps bootcamp to practice the DevOps tools .
   
😀Now i'm trying to dive into DevOps and why not to look for an internship in this field.
